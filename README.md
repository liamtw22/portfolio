# Website Design Portfolio Repository

This repository serves as a showcase for my website design portfolio. It features my best web design project Tadpole, demonstrating my skills and expertise in creating visually appealing and functional websites. 

## Project

Here is a list of the projects included in this portfolio:

1. Tadpole: Tadpole is a more casual and versatile business social media. Tadpole allows users to talk about themselves, respond to prompts such as typical interview questions in video format, and display different professional projects on their profile for companies and other professionals to view.

Each project folder contains a set of high-quality images showcasing the design and layout of the website.
